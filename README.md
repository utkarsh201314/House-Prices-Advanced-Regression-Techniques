## **Workflow**

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- **Data Exploration**: Analyzed the dataset for key trends and patterns.
- **Handling Missing Values**: 
  - Replaced null values in categorical data with the most frequent value (mode).
  - Imputed numerical data using techniques such as mean substitution and inference based on related features.
- **Lot Frontage**: Estimated missing values using a linear regression model between `LotFrontage` and the square root of `LotArea`.

### **2. Feature Engineering**
- Created new composite features, such as total living space, combining internal and external square footage.
- Transformed categorical variables into numerical representations using one-hot encoding for better model compatibility.

### **3. Correlation Analysis**
- Conducted correlation analysis to identify features strongly associated with the target variable (`SalePrice`).
- Visualized relationships using heatmaps to guide feature selection and model improvement.

### **4. Data Splitting**
- Split the dataset into training and testing subsets:
  - **Training Dataset**: Used for model development and validation.
  - **Testing Dataset**: Evaluated model performance on unseen data.
